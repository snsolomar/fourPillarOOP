# What are some advantages of using OOPs?
- promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy
- helps hide unnecessary details with Data Abstraction
- bottom up approach allows developers to define basic objects and their behaviors. Over time, as more objects are defined, they can be composed or extended to form more complex objects.

# What is a class?
- Classes act as templates or blueprints, which contain values, known as member data, and some set of rules, known as behaviors or functions.
- When an object is created, it automatically takes data and functions defined in the class.
- They are basically templates or blueprints for objects.
