# What are some advantages of using OOPs?
- promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy
- helps hide unnecessary details with Data Abstraction
- bottom up approach allows developers to define basic objects and their behaviors. Over time, as more objects are defined, they can be composed or extended to form more complex objects.

# What is a class?
- Classes act as templates or blueprints, which contain values, known as member data, and some set of rules, known as behaviors or functions.
- When an object is created, it automatically takes data and functions defined in the class.
- They are basically templates or blueprints for objects. 

# What is an object?
- Objects refer to the instance of the class, which contains the instance of the members and behaviors defined in the class template

# What are the four pillars of OOP?

1. Encapsulation: it's like putting everything you need inside of a capsule. You want to use the capsule to do certain things, but you don't need to see the inner mechanisms. It is the process of binding data members and methods together, without revealing unnecessary details.

2. Abstraction: Abstraction is only showing what is necessary. For example, you create a method inside of a class. You use that method in your program, but you don't need to see all the details of the method. 

3. Inheritance 
4. Polymorphism
